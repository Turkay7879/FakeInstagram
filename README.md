# FakeInstagram
An Instagram clone written in Swift (Storyboard)

## Used Libraries
- Firebase Storage and FireStore
- Firebase Auth
- SDWebImage

##Â How to Use?
You can simply clone this repository and open the project in Xcode. However, keep in mind that:
- The .plist file used for Firebase wasn't uploaded here since it containts some critical API keys. So without it, project may not run properly even if it's compiled successfully.
- Project was created with Xcode 12.4 and iOS 14.4 SDK in mind. So earlier versions of Xcode may not open the project properly (Although project file compatibility is set to 'Xcode 9.3-compatible' so it may be worth a shot)
